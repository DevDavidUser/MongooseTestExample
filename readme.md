# Express.js and Mongoose Example
This is an example application that demonstrates how to create a simple web server using Express.js and connect it to a MongoDB database using Mongoose.

# Installation
To install the application, first clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
Then, navigate to the project directory and install the dependencies using npm:

npm install
# Usage
To start the server, run the following command:

node main.js
This will start the server and connect it to the MongoDB database. You should see a message in the console indicating that the server is running and has successfully connected to the database.

You can then make a request to the server by navigating to http://localhost:3000 in your web browser. This will create a new Cat object and save it to the database, and you will see the message "hey there" displayed in your browser.
